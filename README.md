# Rocket-N1

## Hello, graveyard!
A pseudo-rocket control system, made a lot of time ago by a friend of mine. Never to be finished.
The rocket planned to use a combination of sugar and potassium nitrate as fuel, with a bit of atomized aluminum to enhance the reaction.
Nothing ever happened, and nothing will ever happen.
